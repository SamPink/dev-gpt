It is one of the best car insurance brands known for the highest claim settlement ratio. It was launched back in Oct 2020 and acquired its initial policyholders by providing a hassle-free claim process, instant policy issuance, and claim settlements at minimum coverages.\nAs it's a fast growing startup, the company would like to optimize the cost of the insurance by identifying the policyholders who are more likely to claim in the next 6 months.\nNow the company would like to use Data Science to identify the policyholders whose chances of filing a claim are high in the next 6 months. The company challenges the Data Science community to build a high-performance algorithm to predict if the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not based on the set of car and policy features.\n\nFeatures\npolicy_id: Unique identifier of the policyholder\npolicy_tenure: Time period of the policy\nage_of_car: Normalized age of the car in years\nage_of_policyholder: Normalized age of policyholder in years\narea_cluster: Area cluster of the policyholder\npopulation density:Population density of the city (Policyholder City)\nmake: Encoded Manufacturer/company of the car\nsegment: Segment of the car (A/ B1/ B2/ C1/ C2)\nmodel: Encoded name of the car\nfuel_type: Type of fuel used by the car\nmax_torque: Maximum Torque generated by the car (Nm@rpm)\nmax_power: Maximum Power generated by the car (bhp@rpm)\nengine_type: Type of engine used in the car\nairbags: Number of airbags installed in the car\nis_esc: Boolean flag indicating whether Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is present in the car or not.\nis_adjustable_steering: Boolean flag indicating whether the steering wheel of the car is adjustable or not.\nis_tpms: Boolean flag indicating whether Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is present in the car or not.\nis_parking_sensors: Boolean flag indicating whether parking sensors are present in the car or not.\nis_parking_camera: Boolean flag indicating whether the parking camera is present in the car or not.\nrear_brakes_type: Type of brakes used in the rear of the car\ndisplacement: Engine displacement of the car (cc)\ncylinder: Number of cylinders present in the engine of the car\ntransmission_type: Transmission type of the car\ngear_box: Number of gears in the car\nsteering_type: Type of the power steering present in the car\nturning_radius: The space a vehicle needs to make a certain turn (Meters)\nlength: Length of the car (Millimetre)\nwidth: Width of the car (Millimetre)\nheight: Height of the car (Millimetre)\ngross_weight: The maximum allowable weight of the fully-loaded car, including passengers, cargo and equipment (Kg)\nis_front_fog_lights: Boolean flag indicating whether front fog lights are available in the car or not.\nis_rear_window_wiper: Boolean flag indicating whether the rear window wiper is available in the car or not.\nis_rear_window_washer: Boolean flag indicating whether the rear window washer is available in the car or not.\nis_rear_window_defogger: Boolean flag indicating whether rear window defogger is available in the car or not.\nis_brake_assist: Boolean flag indicating whether the brake assistance feature is available in the car or not.\nis_power_door_lock: Boolean flag indicating whether a power door lock is available in the car or not.\nis_central_locking: Boolean flag indicating whether the central locking feature is available in the car or not.\nis_power_steering: Boolean flag indicating whether power steering is available in the car or not.\nis_driver_seat_height_adjustable: Boolean flag indicating whether the height of the driver seat is adjustable or not.\nis_day_night_rear_view_mirror: Boolean flag indicating whether day & night rearview mirror is present in the car or not.\nis_ecw: Boolean flag indicating whether Engine Check Warning (ECW) is available in the car or not.\nis_speed_alert: Boolean flag indicating whether the speed alert system is available in the car or not.\nncap_rating: Safety rating given by NCAP (out of 5)\nis_claim: Outcome: Boolean flag indicating whether the policyholder file a claim in the next 6 months or not.\n"

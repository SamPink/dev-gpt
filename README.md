## Introduction

PythonDevAssistant is more than a toolâ€”it's a creative partner. From creating games to setting up complex data analysis tools, PythonDevAssistant has you covered. Whether you're a startup looking to quickly validate your ideas, a researcher in need of custom tools, or a business seeking to automate your workflows, PythonDevAssistant is your solution.

How it Works

The PythonDevAssistant class is the core of this minimal working example. When instantiated, it sets up a chat interface with an OpenAI model, primed to act as a senior Python developer. It accepts prompts in natural language and generates Python code in response. The generated code is designed to be self-contained and easily executable, with no dependencies on local files or external APIs requiring a key.

Using PythonDevAssistant

You can run the PythonDevAssistant as a standalone Python program. Simply create an instance of the class and call the generate_code method with a prompt of your choice. For example:

```python
assistant = PythonDevAssistant()
assistant.generate_code("plot some cool data")
```

The generate_code method attempts to generate a valid Python code snippet in response to the prompt. If the code fails to execute, the method will automatically ask the model for a fix and attempt to execute the fixed code. This process repeats until the code runs successfully or the maximum number of attempts is reached.

Requirements

To run PythonDevAssistant, you will need Python 3.6 or later and the dotenv package installed. The dotenv package is used to load environment variables from a .env file in your project root, which should contain your OpenAI API key.

Goals and Future Work

This minimal working example represents the first step in our journey to revolutionize software development and democratize programming. As we continue to develop PythonDevAssistant, we plan to expand its capabilities and make it even easier to use. We envision a future where anyone, regardless of their coding experience, can rapidly prototype applications, set up data pipelines, create interactive visualizations, and automate routine tasks.
